## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Offline-first (WatermelonDB) is non-negotiable — must be wired on Day 1; retrofitting is a rewrite
- Catalog-constraint architecture has two validation layers: GPT-4o system prompt + backend ID validation
- All prices stored as integer cents; quote_snapshots are write-once via DB trigger
- Audio deleted from R2 immediately after Whisper transcription (PII)
- Polling at 1.5s for AI results (not WebSockets) — sufficient at MVP scale

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Samsung Galaxy A32 FCM kill risk: must test push notifications on physical device before Phase 6 ships
- Android audio buffer: must use FileSystem.moveAsync to documentDirectory immediately post-recording (Phase 5)
- Quote expiry TTL value (SMS-10): default 72h but exact value to be confirmed before Phase 6
